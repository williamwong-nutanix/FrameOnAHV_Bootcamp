Getting Started
---------------

Welcome to the End User Computing bootcamp featuring Xi Frame. This bootcamp is meant to provide you with first hand experience in why Nutanix is an ideal platform for VDI workloads, and can deliver a fully integrated experience with our cloud-hosted broker, Xi Frame. In addition to the benefits than Nutanix HCI brings to any virtual desktop deployment, such as linear scalability and consistent performance, Nutanix brings additional benefits that you'll explore through labs:

- Integration with AHV to provide a no-cost, easy to manage platform for running on-premises virtual desktops
- Fast desktop provisioning, including rolling out image updates to large pools of desktops
- Native file services with Nutanix Files to deliver user data, profiles, and User Personalization Layers
- Native microsegmentation with Nutanix Flow to secure a virtual desktop environment
- Rich monitoring and automation capabilities with Prism Ops

Environment Details
+++++++++++++++++++

Nutanix Workshops are intended to be run in the Nutanix Hosted POC environment. Your cluster will be provisioned with all necessary images, networks, and VMs required to complete the exercises.

Networking
..........

Hosted POC clusters follow a standard naming convention:

- **Cluster Name** - POC\ *XYZ*
- **Subnet** - 10.**21**.\ *XYZ*\ .0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.**21**.\ *XYZ*\ .37

If provisioned from the marketing pool:

- **Cluster Name** - MKT\ *XYZ*
- **Subnet** - 10.**20**.\ *XYZ*\ .0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.**20**.\ *XYZ*\ .37

For example:

- **Cluster Name** - POC055
- **Subnet** - 10.21.55.0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.21.55.37

Throughout the Workshop there are multiple instances where you will need to substitute *XYZ* with the correct octet for your subnet, for example:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - IP Address
     - Description
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .37
     - Nutanix Cluster Virtual IP
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .39
     - **PC** VM IP, Prism Central
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .40
     - **DC** VM IP, NTNXLAB.local Domain Controller

Each cluster is configured with 2 VLANs which can be used for VMs:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 25 25 10 40
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Network Name
    - Address
    - VLAN
    - DHCP Scope
  * - Primary
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .1/25
    - 0
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .50-10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .124
  * - Secondary
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .129/25
    - *XYZ1*
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .132-10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .253

Credentials
